Hello Users ! Memcached is a memory based caching system and it is a great caching tool available for nearly every scripting language.
I use it in php to speed up some applications. I wanted a very clean way to implementing this in my various projects, with as little change
to the existing code as possible. In this package I demonstrate how to cache data into the memcached server and retrive it. Since memcache is an OBJECT caching system,
you canâ€™t simply drop your mysql_query resource into memcache, ask for it at another time, and get your results back :)

Before running this code, be sure that you've a running instance of memcached server.


Thank you very much for downloading the script. Have a great day.
